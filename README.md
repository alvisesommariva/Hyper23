The compressed file HYPER23 270723.zip contains the Matlab codes used for the numerical tests in the work
Hybrid hyperinterpolation over general regions
by Congpei An, Jia-Shu Ran and Alvise Sommariva.

The routines compute several variants of hyperinterpolants, i.e.
• filtered hyperinterpolation,
• lasso hyperinterpolation,
• tikhonov regularization,
• hard-thresholding hyperinterpolation, 
• hybrid hyperinterpolation,

over multivariate domains as
• unit interval, 
• unit disk,
• unit sphere, 
• unit cube,
• union of disks, 
• polygons.

The software is adaptable to more general domains as soon as the Vandermonde matrix, w.r.t. to an orthogonal basis is available, as well as a cubature rule with general algebraic degree of exactness.
To run the demos, go to the pertinent domain folder and digit:
• unit interval: demo_interval_driver_02 
• unit disk: demo_disk_driver_02 
• unit sphere: : demo_sphere_driver_02 
• unit cube: demo_cube_driver_02 
• union of disks: demo_uniondisks_driver_02 
• polygons: demo_uniondisks_driver_02 

In view of the high number of tests, each run may need up to 15 minutes.
