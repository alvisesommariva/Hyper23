Hybrid hyperinterpolation over general regions

by Congpei An, Jia-Shu Ran and Alvise Sommariva.

The routines compute several variants of hyperinterpolants, i.e. 

• filtered hyperinterpolation,
• lasso hyperinterpolation,
• tikhonov regularization,
• hard-thresholding hyperinterpolation, 
• hybrid hyperinterpolation,

over multivariate domains as

• unit interval,
• unit disk,
• unit sphere,
• unit cube,
• union of disks, 
• polygons.

The software is adaptable to more general domains as soon as the Vandermonde matrix, w.r.t. to an orthogonal 
basis is available, as well as a cubature rule with general algebraic degree of exactness.
